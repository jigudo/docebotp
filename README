This modules are a bridge between DoceboLMS and other platforms like Drupal, Joomla, SugarCRM, ...

The main features that this modules will provide once finished are:
* single sign on between Docebo LMS and the other platform
* user synchronization between the two platforms
* a "my courses" list block
* a block for search the Docebo Content library objects


This project is considered "official" but at the same time "external" to Docebo so this means that anyone who can help us in developing it and/or keeping it up-to-date will be able to join and get the opportunity to directly commit updates to the project git repository.
If you are skilled with one of the cms/crm platforms mentioned above, and you wish to contribute, feel free to contact us!
